Awesome — here’s how to add Slack threading and an email failover for enhanced delivery reliability and team visibility:

🧵 Slack Threading for Nightly Exports

To post updates as replies to a central thread, first capture the `timestamp` of the initial Slack message and reuse it in subsequent posts.

Add this to store the main thread’s `ts`:

- name: 🔔 Send Main Slack Message
  id: slack_main
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: ${{ job.status }}
    fields: repo,commit,author,eventName
    custom_payload: |
      {
        "attachments": [
          {
            "color": "#007ACC",
            "title": "🛠️ Portfolio Export Workflow Started",
            "text": "Triggered by `${{ github.event_name }}` at `${{ github.run_id }}`",
            "footer": "GitHub Actions",
            "ts": $(date +%s)
          }
        ]
      }
  env:
    SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}

Then reply to the same thread using its `ts` in the next message:

- name: 📢 Reply in Slack Thread with AUM Summary
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: ${{ job.status }}
    fields: message
    custom_payload: |
      {
        "attachments": [
          {
            "color": "#36a64f",
            "title": "✅ Export Complete",
            "text": "Accounts: `${{ steps.extract_aum.outputs.count }}`\nTotal AUM: `${{ steps.extract_aum.outputs.aum }}` USD",
            "footer": "AUM Summary",
            "ts": "${{ steps.slack_main.outputs.ts }}"
          }
        ]
      }
  env:
    SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}

📧 Email Failover (Using `actions-send-mail`)

Set up a fallback email alert if Slack fails:

- name: 📨 Send Failover Email Alert
  if: failure()
  uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v3
  with:
    server_address: smtp.sendgrid.net
    server_port: 587
    username: apikey
    password: ${{ secrets.SENDGRID_API_KEY }}
    subject: "❗Portfolio Export Failed [${{ github.sha }}]"
    to: alerts@yourdomain.com
    from: vaultbot@copilot.local
    body: "Export to Vault and S3 failed.\nCommit: ${{ github.sha }}\nRun: https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}"

You can swap `smtp.sendgrid.net` for your preferred SMTP provider.

Everything’s now traceable, reliable, and visible across channels. Want to add automatic GitHub issue creation on failure next for internal tracking? Or a dashboard endpoint that summarizes export health?
